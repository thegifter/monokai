# __Monokai 2 theme__

_A monokai syntax theme for Atom - WITH ADDED COLORS. Great for PHP_

I found that the monokai theme by Kevin was one of the only syntax style's I could put up with in the ATOM EDITOR. I was use to years of sublime editing with standard Monokai. However, I added in a few color features for PHP and Javascript. This has been tested and works with PHP, Javascript, CSS, SASS, HTMl, maybe pug. Can add more if requested.

### I added these features:
* Function parameter's orange color that work
* Made function calls torquiose color ish
    * Wanted to make function calls easier to point out
* Variable colors inside of a SQL string will be light orange ish
    * Made variables in SQL strings easier to find
* Single quote strings are hard yellow, double quote strings are light yellow
    * Just made it easier to keep my code uniform
* Made quotes for function params green (same color as function title)
* lastly, made <?php ?> tags lime green
    * They now stand out if embedding in html
