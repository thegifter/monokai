# Monokai 2 theme

A monokai syntax theme for Atom - WITH ADDED COLORS. Great for PHP

I found that the monokai theme by Kevin was one of the only syntax style's I could put up with in the ATOM EDITOR. I was use to years of sublime editing with standard Monokai. HOWEVER, his monokai was lacking a bit (at least for PHP syntax, or my set up is glitchy??). Added more features, mostly tailored to php right now. <ul><h3>So I added in:</h3> <li>Function parameter's orange color that work</li> <li>Made function calls torquiose color ish</li><ul><li>Wanted to make function calls easier to point out</li></ul><li>Variable colors inside of a SQL string will be light orange ish</li><ul><li>Made variables in SQL strings easier to find</li></ul><li>Single quote strings are hard yellow, double quote strings are light yellow</li><ul><li>Just made it easier to keep my code uniform</li></ul><li>Made quotes for function params green (same color as function title)</li><li>lastly, made <?php ?> tags lime green</li><ul><li>They now stand out if embedding in html</li></ul></ul>
